 * @property boolean $channel_chat_created Optional. Service message: the channel has been created.

 * @property integer $migrate_to_chat_id Optional. The group has been migrated to a supergroup with the specified
 *  identifier. This number may be greater than 32 bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent
 *  defects in interpreting it. But it smaller than 52 bits, so a signed 64 bit integer or double-precision float
 *  type are safe for storing this identifier.
 * @property integer $migrate_from_chat_id Optional. The supergroup has been migrated from a group with the
 *  specified identifier. This number may be greater than 32 bits and some programming languages may have
 *  difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it smaller than 52 bits, so a signed 64 bit integer or
 *  double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.
 * @property Message $pinned_message Optional. Specified message was pinned. Note that the Message object in
 *  this field will not contain further reply_to_message fields even if it is itself a reply.
